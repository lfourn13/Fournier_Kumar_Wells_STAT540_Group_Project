Proposal

Motivation and Background work
Our final project will involve RNA-Seq data from the Peter Stirling lab (Focus on genomic instability and cancer). Yeast wild-type data will be compared to two different splice mutants, all previously collected in triplicate.

Aims and Methodology

Our final project will involve RNA-Seq data from the Peter Stirling lab (Focus on genomic instability and cancer). Yeast wild-type data will be compared to two different splice mutants, all previously collected in triplicate. The hypothesis is that there will be a change in the expression data between these splice mutants and the wild-type, specifically a change in the intron retention rate. Genes involved in splicing have many important roles such as modulating protein function and gene expression. Mutations in splicing have been linked to endocrine disorders, dementia and cancer. By disrupting the function of the splicing machinery and analyzing changes in expression, we can better understand the basic mechanisms of gene splicing and how it relates to pathology.
